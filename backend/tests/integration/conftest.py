"""Shared testcontainers-backed fixtures for integration tests.

A single Postgres + Redis *container pair* is started once per test session
(``docker compose`` isn't required — this needs only a working Docker
daemon, see ``docs/testing.md``) since spinning up containers is the
expensive part. The async SQLAlchemy engine itself is rebuilt per test
function, because an ``AsyncEngine``/its connections are bound to the event
loop they were created on, and pytest-asyncio gives each test its own loop
by default — sharing one engine across tests invites hard-to-debug
cross-loop errors. Schema is created directly from ``Base.metadata`` for
speed/isolation; migration *history* correctness is verified separately by
the "migrations" CI job against a real Alembic upgrade/downgrade cycle.
